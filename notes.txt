Config settings are read like a conseq file but that's a bit of overkill. Maybe some settings should
always be availible by reading from a config file so we don't always need a conseq file:
ie: STAGING_URL


Should there be an "unresolved" Rule and a "resolved" instance of Rule?

Most important functionality to add: support for optional.

Requires static analysis to determine which rules are downstream of other rules

Also requires changes to main_loop
